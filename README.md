# Financial Chat

Financial was created to organize some chats about financial. The main difference of this chat is the capacity of getting some stock cotes values, only typing the command "/stock=" in the chat message textbox, for example :"/stock=aapl.us" to get the stock from US apple.

## Installation

There is a docker-compose file to help to up the containers of the redis, sql server and rabbit mq, is not mandatory, but it´s helps.
This app is using 
.NET 7: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0

RabbitMQ: https://www.rabbitmq.com/

Redis cache manager: https://redis.io/

MS SQL Server: https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2019

There is a setup file to help to create the database, it´s possible to use the migrations, but I think it´s easier only running this sql file

## Usage

First of all, you need to create an user in the menu "Register". After, you can login and start a new chat, choose the chat room on the menu Chat on the top right menu
